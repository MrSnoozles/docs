# Horizontal Scaling MySQL

This guide will show you how KubeDB enterprise operator used to scale up/down the number of server nodes of a `MySQL` group replication.

## Before You Begin

- You should be familiar with the following `KubeDB` concepts:
  - [MySQL](/docs/concepts/databases/mysql.md)
  - [MySQLOpsRequest](/docs/concepts/day-2-operations/mysqlopsrequest.md)

## How Horizontal Scaling Process Works

The following diagram shows how KubeDB enterprise operator used to scale up the number of server nodes of a `MySQL` group replication. Open the image in a new tab to see the enlarged version.

The horizontal scaling process consists of the following steps:

1. At first, a user creates a `MySQL` crd.

2. `KubeDB` community operator watches for `MySQL` crd.

3. When it finds one, it creates a `StatefulSet` and related necessary stuff like secret, service, etc.

4. When the user sees the `MySQL` object has arrived in the `ready` state, she creates a `MySQLOpsRequest` crd which specifies the `MySQL` object reference and final expected number of nodes for the group replication.

5. `KubeDB` enterprise operator watches for `MySQLOpsRequest`.

6. When it finds a specific one, it pauses the `MySQL` object so that the `KubeDB` community operator doesn't perform any operation on the `MySQL` during the scaling process.  

7. Then the `KubeDB` enterprise operator will scale the StatefulSet replicas to reach the expected number of nodes/members for the group replication.

8. After successful scaling of the StatefulSet's replica, the `KubeDB` enterprise operator updates the `MySQL` object replicas.

9. After successful scaling of the `MySQL` replicas, the `KubeDB` enterprise operator resumes the `MySQL` object so that the `KubeDB` community operator remues it's actual operations.

At each of the above steps, the `KubeDB` enterprise operator updates the `status` section of the `MySQLOpsRequest`.
